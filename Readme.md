## CSSketch - CSS for Sketch 3
CSSketch is a Sketch 3 plugin that enables you to modify your designs quickly by attaching it a stylesheet to it that you can use to lay out your designs, change colors and shadows quickly, etc.
It supports [{less}](http://lesscss.org) stylesheets, which means you can put functions and variables in your stylesheet to make your workflow even more efficient.

CSSketch is completely open source, so feel free to contribute to its development!

## Download & Install
Download from [Github](https://github.com/JohnCoates/CSSketch/archive/master.zip)

Two ways to install:

**Option A:** Open CSSketch.sketchplugin and Sketch will ask if you'd like it installed

**Option B:** While Sketch 3 is open, go to Plugins -> Reveal Plugins Folder, and place CSSketch.sketchplugin there.

## Using CSSketch

* To enable CSSketch you must run the menu bar option every time Sketch 3 launches. You can find it on the menu bar at Plugins -> CSSketch -> Layout Layers.
* A stylesheet is set on a per-page basis. Set the stylesheet at Plugins -> CSSketch -> Set Page's Stylesheet for every page you want a stylesheet for. Once this is set, simply make changes to the stylesheet and save them to see the effects.


## Features
* **Less Support:** Variables and functions are supported. Find out more at [LessCSS.org](http://lesscss.org)
* **Auto Detect Stylesheet changes:** Set the stylesheet once, and that's it. Changes are detected and applied as soon as you save the stylesheet.
* **Webkit Engine:** CSSketch is powered by the WebKit engine, the same code that powers Safari and Google Chrome.
* **Toolbar Icon:** A toolbar icon is added after running CSSketch for easy applying of changes.
* **Sandbox Support:** CSSketch works with the Mac App Store version of Sketch 3 as well as the regular version.
* **Stylesheet Path Store In Document:** You only ever have to set the stylesheet path once. It's then stored in the document for future use.
